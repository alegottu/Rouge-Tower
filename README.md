# Rouge-Tower

Rogue-Tower is a 2D Platformer and shooter, in which each randomized stage contains a random pool of enemies to spawn, loot to improve your character as you progress through a run, and "tower-stations" which allow you to deploy a defensive tower from a random pool of three towers.

Currently, development is paused, but a prototype for movement, tower deployment, enemy spawning, and some randomization is ready.
